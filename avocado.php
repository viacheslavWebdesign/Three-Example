               <p class="text">Avocado is a fruit from the Persea americana tree, native to south-central Mexico. It has been cultivated for thousands of years, with evidence of its domestication dating back to around 5000 BCE in Mesoamerica. Avocados are known for their creamy texture and are rich in healthy fats.</p>

               <h2 class="title">Unique Fruit</h2>
               <p class="text">What makes avocado unique is its high content of healthy monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, which is beneficial for heart health. Unlike most fruits, which are primarily composed of carbohydrates, avocados are low in sugar and packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals like potassium and vitamin E. Their creamy texture and versatile flavor profile make them a popular ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes, from guacamole to smoothies and even desserts.</p>

               <h2 class="title">Avocado Seed</h2>
               <p class="text">The avocado seed, often overlooked, is packed with nutrients and potential health benefits. It contains a significant amount of fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats. Some studies suggest that the seed has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which could support overall health. Although not commonly consumed, the seed can be ground into a powder and added to smoothies or teas, making it a unique way to utilize the entire fruit and reduce waste.</p>
